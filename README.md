## Making request to API

Making a request to your API is quite simple. The best way to do this is using a tool such as [Postman](http://www.getpostman.com/).

Because we aren't versioning the API in the URI we need to define an Accept header to request a specific version. The header is formatted like so.

```
Accept: application/vnd.YOUR_VENDOR.v1+json

```

In the above example you would replace YOUR_VENDOR with the vendor name you defined in your .env configuration. Again, this is usually something unique to your application, such as its name or identifier, and is usually all lowercase.

Following the vendor name we have the version we want. In the above example we're requesting v1 of our API. This is then followed by a plus sign and the desired format. If the format is invalid the package will attempt to use the default format you defined in your configuration.
